My training and testing code for object recognition using Torch.

This code is largely inspired by eladhoffer's [ImageNet-Training](https://github.com/eladhoffer/ImageNet-Training).

This code requires my
[Torch wrapper](https://github.com/zhfe99/lua_th) and
[Lua library](https://github.com/zhfe99/lua_lib).
